    "In layman's terms, the goal of complexity analysis is to formalize how a program/algorithm perform with respect to increased problem size.\n",

    "**Why are we studying the performance of an algorithm in terms of increasing problem size?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Assuming our algorithm is correct, a practical issue we have to face is the time it takes to solve the problem (along with the space).  If a correct algorithm takes 10 billion years to give a correct solution, then what's the point of running it?  From complexity analysis, we gauge at how well the algorithm perform with an increased problem size.  \n",

    "**How do we study complexity analysis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "From a personal experience, there are two attitudes at looking at complexity analysis: theoreical and practical.  During coding interviews (specifically, facebook), the interviewer tends to ask what is the time complexity or space complexity of the algorithm?  And you are expected to answer quickly without doing the proofs.  As an engineer, we should have some basic experience to relate code structure with time complexity, and have an analytical mind of a scientist to support/verify our instinct.  \n",

    "TLDR:  Try to develop the ability to spot time/space complexity by looking at the code instantly, but also understand the underlying principle to support your claim."
