    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of the case study is to highlight problem solving is not a direct, simple, and clean route.  When you read the textbook, or watch a tutorial online, the answer is already provided to the presenter so the presenter can find the next step in the algorithm perfectly.  It is easy to fall under an illusion that we should hit the perfect route on the first try, and feel dejected when we don't know where to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as we are solving problems, the process is seldom this simple.  As you can see above, it is natural for us to explore different routes.  And it is common some route may lead to dead-end. (Or not a deadend for someone else.) Problem solving is about developing the grit to follow through the thinking process, and the insight to change the thinking direction.  Like many classic algorithms, Euclid's algorithm is developed few thousand years ago by the god of geometry, and refined by hundreds of generations of mathematicians.   So, feeling stuck when solving a problem is completely natural and I would say, normal, for a college student.\n",

    "1. Follow the steps above: identify the problem, explore around, highlight the important insights, develop an algorithm, prove the algorithm's correctness, space and time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ask around for pointers.\n",
    "3. NEVER spend five minutes on a problem, and then google for solution.  There is a huge gap between, *I understand the solution.* and *I can solve this problem.*"
